# Basic Lens Protocol Nodejs App

This repo help you set up basic Lens Protocol Nodejs App which uses Lens Protocol GraphQL API
for fetching/mutating data on Lens Protocol, also setup your own REST API using Express.

## Prerequisites

First setup basic typescript nodejs application using [basic-ts-express-app](https://github.com/anjaysahoo/basic-ts-express-app) repo

## Things that will be covered in this guide are

1. Creating a **simple GET REST API** for fetching data from Lens Protocol
2. **Setting up Prettier with ESLint**
3. **Setting up Husky**
4. Creating a **simple POST REST API** for fetching data from Lens Protocol

Creating a`Base Client` using [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/basics/core/) for all sorts of fetching related stuff from Lens Protocol.

<b>Note: </b> Rationale behind using `URQL` client can be understood from this article [5 GraphQL clients for JavaScript and Node.js](https://blog.logrocket.com/5-graphql-clients-for-javascript-and-node-js/#:~:text=GraphQL-based%20servers%20can%20only,a%20GraphQL%20client%20is%20needed.)

### Step-1:

Refer this article to setup prettier ðŸ‘‰
[How to use Prettier with ESLint and TypeScript in VSCode](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/tooling/prettier/)

### Step-2:

Refer this article to setup ESLint ðŸ‘‰
[How to use ESLint with TypeScript](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/typescript/eslint-for-typescript/)

#### Note:

You start getting `unused error` once you run script `npm run lint` in files like `app.ts`

```typescript
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  res.status(404).json({ message: err.message });
});
```

As next is not used so ESLint throw `unused error`, but if you remove next then you will not get others error.

To resolve this you add new rules in `.eslintrc`

```json
{
  "root": true,
  "rules": {
    "_comment": "Below rule help us ignore any unused variables error thrown by eslint",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": [
      "error",
      {
        "argsIgnorePattern": "^_",
        "varsIgnorePattern": "^_",
        "caughtErrorsIgnorePattern": "^_"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<b>After this you always define any unused variable in your code, by starting variable name with underscore</b>

Example:

```typescript
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, _next: NextFunction) => {
  res.status(404).json({ message: err.message });
});
```

 <summary style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold">Setting Up Husky</summary>

Husky to prevent bad git commits and enforce code standards in your project.

To understand more about husky, refer to this article ðŸ‘‰ [Enforcing Coding Conventions with Husky Pre-commit Hooks](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/tooling/enforcing-husky-precommit-hooks/)

<b>Note: </b>Above article setup is old so follow below steps to set up husky

### Step-1

```sh
npx husky-init && npm install
```

**Note:** Above command may not work in powershell, so try running it in cmd or git bash

### Step-2

```sh
npx husky set .husky/pre-commit "npm run prettier-format && npm run lint"
```

This adds script in `.husky\pre-commit`, which will ensure your code is formatted and linted before committing

After this when ever anyone will try to commit then husky will run script `npm run prettier-format && npm run lint`

### Below are things to expect after this:-

1. If any file contains prettier then those will be fixed, and **you need to commit that fixed code again**.
2. Issue related to linting will be reported, and **you need fix then only you can commit the code**

 <summary style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold">Setting Up Environment Variables</summary>

### Step-1

```shell
npm install dotenv
```

### Step-2

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project

### Step-3

Create a `src\config\env.config.ts` file. We will use this file to get our environment variables.

This help reduce code duplication.

```typescript
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

export const APP_ADDRESS = process.env.APP_ADDRESS as string;
export const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string;
```

Refer this article ðŸ‘‰ [Node.js Everywhere with Environment Variables!](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/making-your-node-js-work-everywhere-with-environment-variables-2da8cdf6e786) for better understanding

## Things to trigger before coding anytime

1. `npm run build` to build your code 2. `npm run start` to start your server
2. `npm run prettier-watch` to format your code automatically

## Improvements(TODO)

1. Add more customizable rules in `.eslintrc` & `.prettierrc`
